<h1 style="text-align: center;">UNDER CONSTRUCTION!</h1>

**Contacts app** is a basic web app development that I´m actually working on. 

It´s a **CRUD** development based on users and contacts, developed under a responsive design.

All the database design is based on MySQL and using Sequelize while coding.

## Contacts app let you:

1. Sign up as an user
2. Update and delete your user.
3. Choose an avatar.
4. Create, update and delete contacts, storing name, cellphone number and avatar for each one.

## Under construction:

1. Contacts API.
2. Full user API (80% developed).
3. Front-end forms validations.
4. Front-end home-page design.



## You will find a *.envTEST* file:

1. Edit it´s name to *'.env'*.

2. Choose an available *port*.

3. Set a *secret* for session configuration.

4. Set your MySQL user´s *password*.

   


## Instalation and first run:

1. `npm install` all dependencies.
2. run `database.sql` (you are going to find some default contacts when creating your first user so you can start testing the app. I hope you like The Simpsons as much as I do).
3. `npm run devstart` (running app with nodemon).
4. *Enjoy!*
